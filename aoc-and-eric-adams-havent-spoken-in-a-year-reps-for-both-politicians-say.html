All across the country, the [Democratic Socialists of America] socialists are mobilizing to stop Eric Adams.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They realize that if I’m successful, we’re going to start the process of regaining control of our cities,’ the former police captain, who campaigned on tenets of addressing New York’s crime problem and putting repeat offenders behind bars.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fueling the fire of their feud, observers say, is the fact that both have something to gain by having a foil from within the currently divided Democratic Party, as both seek to bolster their respective, vastly different audiences and gain fame in the political sphere.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Political outsider Adams, who served as a captain for the NYPD and then the city’s senate for roughly six years, recently attended the highly exclusive MET Gala – which costs $35,000 to attend – and&nbsp;has sought to gain support from the party’s more moderate members.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Since being sworn in in January, the new mayor has been seen partying with Cara Delevingne and rapper A$AP Rocky, and nixed vaccine mandates for athletes in a bid to gain favor with citizens peeved over pandemic policies that saw unvaccinated Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving barred from playing at the Barclay Center.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>AOC, meanwhile – who has seen a meteoric rise since being elected to congress in 2019 –&nbsp;is widely-regarded as America’s most prominent Democrat Socialist of America, showing support for radically left-leaning policies and movement such as Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She is the leader of the so-called ‘Squad’ of hard-left Democrats, which also includes Reps Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.
