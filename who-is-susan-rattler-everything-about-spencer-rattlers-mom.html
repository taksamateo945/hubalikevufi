She has been married to her husband, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mike Rattler</a>, for many years, and their union, which has proved to be an enduring one, produced two kids.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Susan Rattler’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Susan Konkel Rattler</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 17th March 1970</li><li><strong>Susan Rattler’s Age:</strong> 53</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Pisces</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Susan Rattler’s Husband (Wife):</strong> Mike Rattler</li><li><strong>Susan Rattler’s Children:</strong> Spencer and Olivia Rattler</li><li><strong>Susan Rattler’sHeight in Inches:</strong> 6 feet 1 inch</li><li><strong>Susan Rattler’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 185 cm</li><li><strong>Susan Rattler’s Weight:</strong> 79 kg</li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> @susanrattler</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Susan Rattler?</strong></h2><p>Though this has never been verified, there are online sources claiming that Susan Rattler was born on the 17th of March 1970, and if this date is anything to go by, she would be 53. Of Caucasian roots, Susan’s nationality is captured as American.</p><p>Her full name is Susan Konkel Rattler. Apart from these tidbits, nothing else is known about her early life and family background. No info about her mum, dad, and siblings. She only became famous as a celebrity mother in the United States.</p><h2><strong>Susan is a Married Woman</strong></h2><p>Because she has never been a mainstream celebrity, thus, details about Susan’s personal life have never been an issue of public interest. The only fact that is known about her love life is that she is enjoying an enduring interracial marriage with her husband, Michael “Mike” Rattler.</p><p>Exactly when, how, and where the two tied the nuptials have never been disclosed, but considering the age of her first child, who just hit his twenties, fans have long concluded that the couple has been together for over two decades.</p><p>Alongside her spouse, Susan is currently residing in Phoenix, Arizona, where they are bringing up their children.</p><h2><strong>Spencer Rattler is Susan Rattler First Child</strong></h2><p>Spencer Rattler, whose date of birth reads 28th of September 2000, is Susan Rattler’s first child. Spencer was born with a special body coloration that makes people think he is an albino, but he is not. The cause of the youngster’s pigmentation has been found to be his mum and dad, who are from different races – Susan comes from Caucasian roots, while Mike has African-American heritage.</p><p>Spencer achieved his basic academic qualifications in his place of birth, Phoenix, Arizona, as a student at Pinnacle High School. His days in high school were quite eventful as the young man was a three-sport stand-out in football, baseball, and basketball. His passing yards in football were quite admirable, and before the end of his junior year, Susan’s son set a new record in High School football history. He joined a Netflix documentary known as QB:1 Beyond the Lights during his senior year.</p><p>The aspiring NFL quarterback became a student at the University of Oklahoma immediately after high school graduation and was welcomed into the team of Oklahoma Sooners. Spencer led his FC to a 6th successive Big 12 Championship, emerging victorious 27 to 21 over Iowa State. He is currently with South Carolina University and is slated to play during the next season.</p><h3><strong>Does Susan Rattler Have Other Children Besides Spencer?</strong></h3><p>The records have revealed that Susan Rattler is a mother of two. The American lady has a son (Spencer Rattler) and a daughter (Olivia Rattler). Her two children are excelling in collegiate sports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Susan-Rattler-posing-for-a-photo-with-her-family-during-an-award-ceremony-e1668949408679.jpg><h3><strong>Susan Rattler’s Last Child is Olivia Rattler</strong></h3><p>The second child born to Susan and her husband, Mike, is Olivia Rattler, who came into the world on the 17th of December 2002. Olivia is equally an alum of Pinnacle High School, Arizona, where her big brother graduated from, and in the same way as spencer, Susan’s only daughter participated in her school’s sporting activities majoring in volleyball.</p><p>The 21 year-old Olivia is currently doing her first year at Missouri State University and has joined their volleyball team. Growing up in Phoenix, Arizona, Susan Rattler’s children would visit local parks to practice sports. Sometimes, they would make do with the garden in the back of their house.</p><p>Olivia made this revelation during a brief interview session with The Oklahoman. Olivia said that was the story of how the two of them developed a love for sports.</p><h3><strong>Susan is Quite Close to her Children</strong></h3><p>The mother of two is devoted to her two children and has been a pillar of support for both Spenser and Olivia. Though her account on Instagram is set to private, reports said she had inundated the page with images and videos of her children. She never misses celebrating their achievements and anniversaries.</p><p>Just like her husband Mike, Susan Rattler has always been there for her kids.</p><h2><strong>What Does Spencer Rattler’s Mom Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Susan Rattler is no celebrity. The mother of Spencer Rattler is engaged in a mundane job as a classroom teacher; she handles students who are in the second grade as a teacher.</p><p>There are online accounts claiming that Susan has gone on to become a writer, but this claim has never been verified, and neither have we seen any publication from her.</p><h3><strong>Spencer Has Done Well in Reciprocating His Parent’s Love and Support</strong></h3><p>Spencer obviously cherished the support he received from both parents. According to the quarterback, he owed all his success to Mike and Susan, who have been super supportive. Talking to Oklahoma University Insider, the up-and-coming NFL player referred to his mom, dad, and sister as his most important support system.</p><p>He never misses an opportunity to celebrate both of them on special occasions by sending them shout-outs through his socials.</p><h3><strong>The Mother of Two is on Social Media.</strong></h3><p>Susan is obviously the type that prefers to keep the details of their personal and professional life away from the scrutiny of the media and general public, but she managed to create a presence on social media.</p><p>The New York resident has her own Instagram handle, but in a bid to continue protecting her privacy, she had to set it to private. With that said, it is only those who follow her that can have access to any pictures and videos she shares through the account. She is nowhere to be found on other platforms like TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, and others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmarpaiur3nRmqutpJWneqbCxKuwraCZo7RurcGorK1lo6Wyr6%2FEq2SrmaSpuaa%2B0makqKVf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-susan-rattler-everything-about-spencer-rattlers-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-susan-rattler-everything-about-spencer-rattlers-mom.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-susan-rattler-everything-about-spencer-rattlers-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-susan-rattler-everything-about-spencer-rattlers-mom.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-susan-rattler-everything-about-spencer-rattlers-mom.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-susan-rattler-everything-about-spencer-rattlers-mom.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ryan-carson-wiki-age-parents-children.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ryan-carson-wiki-age-parents-children.html>Ryan Carson: Wikipedia, Age, Parents, Children and Tragic Stabbing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dwayne-johnson-daughter-simone-alexandra-johnson.html>Who is Dwayne Johnsons Daughter, Simone Alexandra Johnson?
