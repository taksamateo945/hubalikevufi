Williams?</span></h2><p>Serena Jameka Williams, born on September 26, 1981, is a revered retired professional tennis player from the United States.</p><p>Widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players in history, Serena has left an indelible mark on the sport.</p><p>She held the esteemed world No. 1 ranking in singles by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) for an incredible 319 weeks, including a record-breaking streak of 186 consecutive weeks.</p><p>Throughout her illustrious career, Serena secured the year-end No. 1 player position five times.</p><p>Her exceptional talent and determination propelled her to clinch 23 Grand Slam women’s singles titles, setting a remarkable record in the Open Era and securing her place as the second highest on the all-time list.</p><p>Notably, Serena stands alone as the only player to achieve a career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.</p><p>Serena’s journey in tennis began under the guidance of her parents, Oracene Price and Richard Williams, who also coached her older sister Venus.</p><p>She turned professional in 1995, and her first major singles victory came at the 1999 US Open.</p><p>From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, Serena displayed unparalleled dominance by consecutively winning all four major singles titles, defeating Venus in the finals each time.</p><p>This remarkable achievement, known as the ‘Serena Slam,’ solidified her non-calendar year Grand Slam and career Grand Slam status.</p><p>Following this impressive run, Serena continued to accumulate two more singles majors, but faced setbacks due to injuries and a decline in form.</p><p>However, beginning in 2007, she made a gradual comeback, reclaiming the world No. 1 ranking.</p><p>Starting from the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Serena embarked on another era of dominance, capturing Olympic gold (thus completing the Career Golden Slam in singles) and securing eight out of thirteen singles majors.</p><p>Her triumphs included four consecutive titles from 2014 to 2015, earning her a second “Serena Slam.”</p><p>At the 2017 Australian Open, Serena clinched her 23rd major singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf’s Open Era record.</p><p>Following her pregnancy, Serena took a break from professional tennis and made an impressive return, reaching four major finals.</p><p>In August 2022, she announced her forthcoming “evolution” away from professional tennis and played her expected final match at the 2022 US Open.</p><p>In addition to her extraordinary singles success, Serena, alongside her sister Venus, won 14 major women’s doubles titles, maintaining an unbeaten record in major doubles finals.</p><p>Their remarkable partnership made them the most successful duo in major finals across all disciplines of the sport.</p><p>Notably, they achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the 2009 Wimbledon Championships and the 2010 French Open, solidifying their claim to the doubles world No. 1 ranking.</p><p>Serena’s excellence extended to the Olympic Games, where she secured four gold medals—three in women’s doubles, a joint record, and one in singles.</p><p>Together with Venus, Serena stands as the only women in the Open Era to achieve Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.</p><p>Additionally, Serena triumphed in two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998, solidifying her status as the sole player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams: one in women’s singles and two in same-sex doubles.</p><p>The arrival of the Williams sisters ushered in a new era of power and athleticism in women’s professional tennis.</p><p>Serena’s exceptional career totals 39 major titles, including 23 in singles, 14 in women’s doubles, and two in mixed doubles.</p><p>She occupies the joint-third position on the all-time list and ranks second in the Open Era for total major titles.</p><p>Serena boasts the distinction of being the most recent woman to hold all four major singles titles simultaneously, achieving this feat in 2002–2003 and 2014–2015.</p><p>Furthermore, she is the most recent woman to accomplish the Surface Slam, triumphing on hard, clay, and grass courts in the same calendar year, a feat she achieved in 2015.</p><p>Alongside Venus, she remains the most recent player to concurrently hold all four major women’s doubles titles, accomplished between 2009–2010.</p><p>In terms of earnings, Serena claimed the title of the highest-paid female athlete in 2016, amassing nearly $29 million.</p><p>She repeated this achievement in 2017, standing as the sole woman on Forbes’ list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with a combination of $27 million in prize money and endorsements.</p><p>Serena’s remarkable achievements have garnered her numerous accolades.</p><p>She holds the record for the most Laureus Sportswoman of the Year awards, winning it four times (in 2003, 2010, 2016, and 2018).</p><p>Furthermore, she was named Sports Illustrated’s Sportsperson of the Year in December 2015, solidifying her status as one of the most celebrated athletes in the world.</p><p>Serena also stands as the highest-earning woman athlete of all time, a testament to her immense talent and enduring legacy.</p><table><tr><th>Information</th><th>Details</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Serena Jameka Williams</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>41 years old</td></tr><tr><td>Birth
