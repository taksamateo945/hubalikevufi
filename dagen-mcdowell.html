She hails from an Irish family and holds American nationality.</p><p>Growing up in the south, Dagen is said to have a North Carolina accent. However, some people have accused her of faking it. In response to a tweet that accused her of having a fake accent, Dagen politely replied, “I grew up in the south. So how does Varney have a British accent after living in the US for 40+ years?”</p><p>Dagen graduated from Wake Forest University, where she studied art history. She began her career as a financial journalist in the Institutional Investor’s Newsletter department. Today, Dagen is a prominent American anchor and analyst, working for Fox News Channel’s Fox Business Network and as a business correspondent. Her works include appearances on Cashin’ IN, Hannity, and Your World with Neil Cavuto.</p><p>Aside from her love for dogs and southern roots, Dagen also has a passion for cars and racing. She even took her driving test in a Ford F150 at 16 and used to drive a Ford Bronco in high school and college. Dagen is also a fan of the Washington Redskins and enjoys listening to music, with some of her favorites being ‘The Weight,’ ‘Rock & Roll,’ and ‘Natural Forces.’</p><p>Despite her busy career, Dagen McDowell takes care of herself and has a stunning physique.

Her mother’s name was Joyce Holt, who unfortunately passed away from cancer in 2019 at 81. Dagen’s father, Charles Ross McDowell, is a healthy man who is still a big part of her life today.</p><p>Dagen has been vocal about her love for her parents on her Instagram, frequently posting pictures of her dad and expressing her deep love for her late mother. In a recent post on February 5, 2021, she wrote, “I miss you every minute of every day, Momma. Fuck cancer.” It’s clear that her mother meant the world to her, and she hates cancer for taking her life.</p><p>Aside from her parents, Dagen also has a brother named Landon Oakes McDowell, who is married to Sara Thomas McDowell. They have a daughter who is currently living in Virginia. Although Dagen is somewhat private about her personal life, her Instagram page showcases how much her family and dogs mean to her.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Dagen McDowell (@dagenmcdowell)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=dagen-mcdowell-relationship-married-life-and-kids>Marriage</h2><p>Dagen McDowell and <a href=#>economic analyst Jonas Max Ferris</a> met on the set of the popular stocks and investment news program Cashin’ In. Due to their argumentative nature, the two were selected to argue about mutual funds on the show, which turned out to be fateful. Although it’s unclear when they fell in love, it’s safe to say that their shared passion for finance brought them together.</p><p>At the time, Dagen was still married to someone else, but things didn’t work out, and she got divorced. Jonas supported her during this time, and they began dating in 2003. The couple’s strong bond eventually led them to tie the knot in 2005.</p><p>Once Dagen’s husband Jonas mentioned, “We were sort of handpicked-At least I think I was handpicked, I don’t Know about Dagen- To Argue in a mutual fun faceoff on the show…cast to because of our argumentative nature.” Even though the marriage occurred years ago, nobody knows if they have kids yet.
