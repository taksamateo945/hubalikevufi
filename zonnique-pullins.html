She joined Bahja Rodriguez and Breanna Womack to create one-third of the girl trio OMG Girlz while they were teenagers. Pullins has released a number of singles as a solo artist, including the song “Pretty Hustle.” She also performed the “Slow” single in 2011 with R&B singer Jacob Latimore. Pullins was lucky to be born into a creative family because her stepfather, rap artist T.I., and her mother, R&B singer Tameka Harris, both perform music.</p><p>Messiah, Major, King, and Domani are her four brothers, along with Domani. She also has a stepfather named Clifford Harris, two sisters named Deyjah and Heiress, and two other siblings. Pullins’ relatives and close friends refer to her as Nique Nique.</p><h2>Zonnique Pullins Age, Height And Weight</h2><p><strong>Zonnique Pullins</strong> was born on March 20, 1996, making her 27 years old as of 2023. She weighs 57 kilograms and stands 5 feet, 2 inches tall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/zonnique-pullins-1-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>Pullins’ innately musical nature was sparked by the musical atmosphere she was raised in. Her parents are both musicians. She developed a greater love for music as she grew. Pullins’ mother was compelled to enroll daughter in an art school as a result. Consequently, Pullins founded the pop group “OMG Girlz” in 2009 with Lourdes Rodriguez, Breanna Womack, and Reginae Carter. But only a few months after the group’s creation, Reginae Carter and Lourdes quit. However, the group’s career was unaffected by this decision, as they went on to win a national competition and perform at the Scream Tour: Next Generation.</p><p>Fortunately, the group gained notoriety after Gucci This, a single that was released by the group. They later started releasing songs like Where The Boys At?, Baddie, and Lover Boy. On addition to the group, Zonnique has participated in T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle with her family. The program ran from 2011 to 2017 for six years. Zonnique has amassed a net worth of roughly $5 million as a result of her album sales and performances.</p><h2>Zonnique Pullins Net Worth</h2><p>R & B singer Zonnique Pullins has a net worth of about $1 million as of December 2023. Knowing that someone as young as Zonnique has such a high net worth is astonishing. Many 60-year-olds strive for it, but the young, talented girl already has it. The amount of money she makes as a wage, on the other hand, is still being scrutinized. The majority of Pullins’ money comes from her work as a professional R&B singer.</p><p>In light of Zonnique’s current success, it may be concluded that everyone can achieve their goals. Age is not a prerequisite for being anything you want to be. Anyone may achieve greatness if the correct environment is present. We still anticipate more from Zonnique because she has not yet reached the pinnacle of her career.</p><h2>Zonnique Pullins Husband, Marriage</h2><p>According to rumors, Pullins dated Bandhunta Izzy, who was her boyfriend. Rapper Izzy is one. Midway through 2018, the two began dating, and they are still passionately in love. She did, however, previously had relationships with musician Zoey Zuko and NFL athlete Damian Swann. When a person is actively involved in romantic relationships with various people, that period of time is known as dating. When two famous people who are not married are spotted together in public, they are frequently referred to be “dating.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGixqKaenr62sYyprKWkmaPAcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzonnique-pullins.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzonnique-pullins.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzonnique-pullins.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzonnique-pullins.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzonnique-pullins.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzonnique-pullins.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-serena-williams-pregnant.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-serena-williams-pregnant.html>Is Serena Williams Pregnant?
