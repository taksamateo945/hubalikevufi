Such is the story of four-time F1 world champion, Alain Prost’s son, <strong>Sacha Prost</strong>.</p><p><strong>Alain Prost</strong> retired in 1993 as the most significant driver in F1 history. Furthermore, nicknamed ‘The Professor’ for his intellectual approach to the competition, he further prioritized his family immensely. Married to Anne Marie Prost in the 1980s, the couple welcomed two boys, and that became a turning point for the family man.</p><p>Today, we will be talking about the icon’s second son, Sacha Prost, below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Second_Son_Of_Alain_Prost_and_Anne_Marie_Prost></span>Second Son Of Alain Prost and Anne Marie Prost<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alain is undoubtedly one of the greatest racers in F1 history. Prost married <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Anne Marie Prost</strong></a> in 1980 and gave birth to two beautiful sons, Nicolas and Sacha, who are hugely successful today.</p><p>Furthermore, Alain Prost welcomed his second child,<strong> Sacha Prost</strong> on May 30, 1990, with wife, Anne. He was only three when Alain retired, but racing was always a part of his childhood. He grew up with his elder brother, <strong>Nicolas Prost</strong>. Alain’s kid, Sacha, has always been a bright child. Sacha also has a half-sister from his father’s side, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Victoria Prost</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Alain-Prost-and-Sacha-Prost.jpg><p>He <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">graduated</a> from the Glion Institute of Higher Education with BBA in 2013 and American University for Washington Mentorship Program. Likewise, Sacha attended Institut Le Rosey to study international baccalaureate.</p><p>Besides studying, he also worked as an intern in Team One Groupe as a business management and development intern.

The F1 rider was driving on a small Swiss road with Nicolas and one of his friends when he turned into a railway crossing where the train had just arrived.</p><p>Unfortunately, the high-speed train collided with the car pushing it more than thirty meters forward. Thankfully, no one was critically hurt in the frightening accident.</p><p>Furthermore, Anne birthed her second child, Sacha, a month and a half later. Today, Sacha grew up to become a successful entrepreneur and co-owns a clothing brand.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Co-Founder_Of_8Js></span>Co-Founder Of 8Js<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The four-time F1 world champion, Alain Prost’s son, Sacha Prost, diverted his career from his father. As Alain was one of the greatest racers of all time, he found an opportunity to make a clothing line for the athletes, hence the 8Js.</p><p>Furthermore, Sacha co-founded the clothing brand with his brother, Nicolas Prost, and sister-in-law, <strong>Delphine Frey</strong>. The motor racing-inspired clothing brand started in 2013 as the siblings were <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">brainstorming</a> as they found out that automobile inspired brands didn’t move them. Hence, 8Js commits to the highest quality standards and prioritizes comfort, ease of movement, and durability.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by 8JS (@8js_official)</a> on Aug 3, 2020 at 12:33pm PDT</p><p>Interestingly, Alain Prost’s son was at university studying sports, events, and entertainment when they started the brand.
